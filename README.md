### Why Though?

One repository that is a collection of demos, small contained projects that can live in its own component, where I can learn TypeScript and further explore my React Skills by implementing simple demos (clock,counter,etc) and optimzation techniques (memoization, composition, debounce, etc).

vs....

creating multiple 'overkill' create-react-app projects for each 'demo' or optimizations

### Deployments

Active Deployments 

- [x] via [ Netlify ](https://dev0-react-demos.netlify.app/)

- [ ] via AWS Services

### Active Demos

Simple Demos
- [ ] Counter
- [ ] Stop Watch
- [ ] Calculator
- [ ] Analog Clock
- [ ] Image Scraper
- [ ] Login Form
- [ ] Digital Clock
- [ ] Query a Table
- [ ] Searchable Photo Gallery

Optimization Techniques
- [x] Cache Component
  - [x] with useState Hook
- [ ] Memoization
- [ ] Debounce 
- [ ] Throttle
- [ ] Composition

## Roadmap (tentative)

- [x] Create Basic React and TypeScript project using create-react-app tool
  - [x] prune the template project created from create-react-app + keep cool looking react logo
- [x] Deploy main branch to Netlify
- [ ] Add CI/CD via GitHub
  - [ ] create .gh dir
- [ ] Add Testing using Jest     
- [ ] Web Responsive on most devices (i.e. mobile,tablet,laptop, widescreen etc)
